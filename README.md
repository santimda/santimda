- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Santiago del Palacio, an astrophysicist doing research in high-energy phenomena. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in numerical calculations of radiative processes. I code mostly in Fortran90, but I'm interested in improving my skills in python.
- Iâ€™m always open for scientific collaborations!
